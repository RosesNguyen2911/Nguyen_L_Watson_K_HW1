# ⭐ Star Wars Character & Film Guide

An interactive front-end web application that allows users to explore **Star Wars characters** and view detailed information about the **films** they appear in, using data fetched from the **Star Wars API (SWAPI)**.

This project was created as part of a front-end development assignment focused on **AJAX requests**, **DOM manipulation**, **HTML template usage**, and **responsive user interface design**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Star Wars Character & Film Guide allows users to:

- Browse a dynamically generated list of Star Wars characters
- Search and filter characters by name in real time
- Select a character to view the films they appear in
- View movie details including title, episode number, director, release date, and opening crawl
- Experience smooth scrolling, loading feedback, and error handling

The project demonstrates how reusable HTML templates can be combined with asynchronous JavaScript to build dynamic, data-driven interfaces.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – semantic and accessible markup  
- **HTML `<template>`** – reusable UI components for characters and movies  
- **CSS3 / SCSS** – custom styling, animations, and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – data fetching, DOM manipulation, and event handling  
- **GSAP (GreenSock)** – smooth scrolling animations  
- **Star Wars API (SWAPI)** – https://swapi.info/api/

---

## 📦 Features

- Character list rendered dynamically using **HTML template elements**  
- Movie details populated through cloned templates  
- External API data fetching using the Fetch API  
- Real-time search filtering  
- Loading spinner to indicate active data requests  
- Error overlay for failed API requests  
- Responsive layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Character data is fetched from the **SWAPI `/people` endpoint**
2. The API returns an array of character objects, which is limited to **12 characters** for layout consistency
3. Character cards are generated by **cloning an HTML `<template>`**, ensuring a consistent and reusable structure
4. Each character card stores related film URLs using `data-*` attributes
5. When a character is selected:
   - Each associated film URL is fetched individually
   - Movie details are rendered by cloning a movie template
   - The page scrolls smoothly to the movie section once all data is loaded
6. Loading and error states are handled gracefully throughout the process

## 🎨 Design Approach

- Mobile-first responsive design  
- Sci-fi inspired visual style inspired by the Star Wars universe  
- Clear visual hierarchy and readable typography  
- Card-based layout for characters and movies  
- Hover and focus states to improve usability and interaction feedback  

---

## ⚠ Known Limitations

- Character and movie poster images are mapped locally by name/title  
- API availability depends on the SWAPI service uptime  
- Character pagination beyond the initial set is intentionally not implemented  

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience with:

- Using HTML `<template>` elements for reusable UI components  
- Fetching and handling data from third-party APIs  
- Managing asynchronous JavaScript workflows using Promises  
- Rendering dynamic content in a clean and maintainable way  
- Implementing loading and error states for better user experience
